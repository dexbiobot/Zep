# MOD ACTIONS & MUTES


**HOW TO USE AGE AND EXPORT FLAGS IN MUTE COMMAND**


`-export` simply exports the result to an archive link
e.g: `!mutes -e` would give you a link rather than show it all on the channel

`-age` allows you to restrict the command to only show mutes older than X period
e.g: `!mutes -age 2h` would only show mutes that have been active for 2h or longer


ðŸ”‡ **HOW TO HARDMUTE**

`remove_roles_on_mute: true` removes roles on mute

`restore_roles_on_mute:true`gives back the roles upon unmute

`kick_from_voice_channel: true` muted users are also immediately kicked from their current voice channel

Bonus!
`remove_roles_on_mute: ["role 1", "role 2"]` those specific roles are removed upon mute

**MOD ACTION TIP**

`can_act_as_other` allows you to use the `-mod` option for commands such as `!ban` - this will set the case's moderator as the user you specify, and also mention your name below theirs if you view the case

**MOD ACTION TIP**
`create_cases_for_manual_actions` - Manual actions wouls be stuff like right click ban, right click kick

Zepp will take the reason you put and make a case for that action with that reason

**BAN TIP**

Add this to your ban message to give it that extra zing

ðŸ“£ **GOOD TO KNOW**
Massbans are logged as cases but not automatically posted on your case log channel since it would be very spammy

You *should* be able to see those cases if you do `!cases <userid>` for one of the banned users however

**NOTIFY TIP**

Available variables are  `off` / `dm` / `channel`

if using channel, `-notify-channel` is also required to be set!
