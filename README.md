**CONSIDER PUTTING A ⭐️ ON THIS REPO**

### What is Zeppelin ?

>Zeppelin is a bot that offers high level of customization, its basically build a bot where you decide what you want the bot to do.

### How to use zep ?

> You use zep via online dashboard, unlike most dashboard you control the entire thing by updating just one file (its called a yaml file). There are various plugins/modules that you enable and customize.

### Where do I start ?

The bot works as follows, you can have levels from 1 to 100. By default, zeppelin assumes mod as level 50, and admin as level 100 but you can change that once you get used to the bot.

**Step 1:** Set the prefix

**Step 2:** Insert role IDs for level 50 and 100

**Step 3:** Type plugins

 This is where you will start enabling modules later on

**EXAMPLE SETUP**

The image below shows what the dashboard looks like after you set all these. In this example we enabled the `auto_reactions` plugin. Note that the `success_emoji` and `error_emoji` are optional if you want to set your own you can but if you dont type anything, it will use the default.
