###  MISCELLANEOUS

ðŸ’¡ **TIP**

>Overrides are always calculated top down. For example,
If you want to have mods messages not be deleted, your overrides would need to be in this order:
>-  Enable in channel xyz
-  Disable for mods
If you have it the other way round it'll delete everything, even from mods.



```yml
    overrides:

    - role: "766285827612999752" #disable rule once role is given
      config:
        rules:
          autorole:
            enabled: true

    - level: '>=50'
      config:
        can_view_antiraid: true
        can_set_antiraid: true
        rules:
          badwords:
            enabled: false
          copypasta:
            enabled: false
```




**MULTIPLE CHANNELS IN OVERRIDE**

```yaml
overrides:
  - channel:
      - "534722948246929429" #channel 1
      - "739034889399042129" #channel 2
    config:
      settings here
```


**SAVE TO DATABASE**

> Zeppelin needs to have the message saved locally to be able to figure out the channel id (which is needed for a lot of things) such as reaction roles!

 `!save_messages_to_db CHANNELID MESSAGEID`



**YAML VALIDATOR**  http://www.yamllint.com/



**ZEPPELIN RESTARTED?**

It restarts in one of these cases:

Many errors in quick succession
Fatal error (instant crash)
Someone restarts it manually
Drag pushes an update
