# AUTOMOD + COUNTERS

**COUNTER TIP**

>Counter decays are currently processed every 5 minutes. They are, however, still applied according to the decay time, even if it's lower than 5 minutes, so "1 every 30s" would decay 10 points at once every 5 minutes.


**COUNTER DECAY**

> Counter decays are currently processed every 5 minutes. They are, however, still applied according to the decay time, even if it's lower than 5 minutes, so "1 every 30s" would decay 10 points at once every 5 minutes.

**LOOSE MATCHING**

`loose_matching` allows a number of letters
(controlled by `loose_matching_threshold`)
*between* letters for word matching
so e.g. if you wanted to match "hello" and enabled `loose_matching`, it would also match e.g. "h|e|l|l|o"

**ALERT TIP**
`replieduser` is whether or not to ping the user you are replying to



**AUTOMOD TIP**

>setting up an automod config that insta-bans people if they mention more than 15 people in the same message
 use `mention_spam` with amount 15, within 0s
 as the trigger

`only_full_words`
- if `true`: if it needs to filter `banana` in a message it'll delete `I am a banana` but not `I am a banananan`
- if `false`: if it needs to filter `banana` in a message it'll delete both `banana` and `bananana`

`normalize`
When enabled, the matched text is normalized (converted to alphanumeric) before matching
- Allows matching text even when some letters have been replaced by similar looking letters from other alphabets

`loose_matching` and `loose_matching_threshold`
- When `loose_matching` is enabled, words are matched even when there are other letters or spaces between the letters

- `loose_matching_threshold` controls how many extra letters, at most, can be between the letters (spaces are unlimited). Defaults to 4.


**REGEX TIP**

`(<a?:[\w~]{2,32}:\d{17,19}>)` is an emoji regex for animated and non-animated emojis.




ðŸ“£ **GOOD TO KNOW**
the default modifier, if not specified, is `>=`




**REGEX TIP**

`((<a?:[\w~]{2,32}:\d{17,19}>)[\S\s]*?){5,}` - Detect 5 or more emoji's in a message. You can replace 5 with whatever you want.
