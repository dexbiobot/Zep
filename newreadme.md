# ZEP BY DEX
![Zep banner](assets/zepbanner.png)


**CONSIDER PUTTING A ‚≠êÔ∏è ON THIS REPO**

### What is Zeppelin ?

>Zeppelin is a bot that offers high level of customization, its basically build a bot where you decide what you want the bot to do.

### How to use zep ?

> You use zep via online dashboard, unlike most dashboard you control the entire thing by updating just one file (its called a yaml file). There are various plugins/modules that you enable and customize.

### Where do I start ?

The bot works as follows, you can have levels from 1 to 100. By default, zeppelin assumes mod as level 50, and admin as level 100 but you can change that once you get used to the bot.

**Step 1:** Set the prefix

**Step 2:** Insert role IDs for level 50 and 100

**Step 3:** Type plugins

 This is where you will start enabling modules later on

**EXAMPLE SETUP**

The image below shows what the dashboard looks like after you set all these. In this example we enabled the `auto_reactions` plugin. Note that the `success_emoji` and `error_emoji` are optional if you want to set your own you can but if you dont type anything, it will use the default.

![Example Config](assets/dashboard.png)

### What plugins are there ?

Whoa!, you here already? What a pro. There are many plugins which I cover in detail.

### Auto Reactions

<details>
  <summary>Click to view</summary>
Often used for suggestion channel, adds reactions to every message on set channel

### Automod

<details>
  <summary>Click to view</summary>

**LOOSE MATCHING**

`loose_matching` allows a number of letters
(controlled by `loose_matching_threshold`)
*between* letters for word matching
so e.g. if you wanted to match "hello" and enabled `loose_matching`, it would also match e.g. "h|e|l|l|o"

**ALERT TIP**
`replieduser` is whether or not to ping the user you are replying to

#### USAGE
![Image](assets/counters.png)

**AUTOMOD TIP**

>setting up an automod config that insta-bans people if they mention more than 15 people in the same message
 use `mention_spam` with amount 15, within 0s
 as the trigger

`only_full_words`
- if `true`: if it needs to filter `banana` in a message it'll delete `I am a banana` but not `I am a banananan`
- if `false`: if it needs to filter `banana` in a message it'll delete both `banana` and `bananana`

`normalize`
When enabled, the matched text is normalized (converted to alphanumeric) before matching
- Allows matching text even when some letters have been replaced by similar looking letters from other alphabets

`loose_matching` and `loose_matching_threshold`
- When `loose_matching` is enabled, words are matched even when there are other letters or spaces between the letters

- `loose_matching_threshold` controls how many extra letters, at most, can be between the letters (spaces are unlimited). Defaults to 4.


**REGEX TIP**

`(<a?:[\w~]{2,32}:\d{17,19}>)` is an emoji regex for animated and non-animated emojis.




üì£ **GOOD TO KNOW**
the default modifier, if not specified, is `>=`




**REGEX TIP**

`((<a?:[\w~]{2,32}:\d{17,19}>)[\S\s]*?){5,}` - Detect 5 or more emoji's in a message. You can replace 5 with whatever you want.

### Cases

<details>
  <summary>Click to view</summary>
  
This plugin  shows all the cases in a set channel
>![image](assets/cases.png)
> 
> *An example of cases channel*

`log_automatic_actions: true` 

Enabling this logs all manually created actions as well , such as when u right click and ban manually instead of using bot commands.

`case_log_channel: "1234"` 

This setting allows you to set the channel for logging all your cases, in this instance, `1234` is the channel ID

‚è≤Ô∏è  **RELATIVE TIME**

`show_relative_times: true` This enables the relative time setting

`relative_time_cutoff: 7d` is the amount of time after which `!cases` will show the full date, not a relative time (e.g. "5 hours ago")

so if you set relative time cutoff to 24h, any cases older than 24h would show the full date, e.g. "2021-01-30", rather than e.g. "1 day ago"



`case_colors` [Optional] This setting allows you to customize the embed strip color for various actions such as warn,mute etc. You can either type color names like `yellow` `green` or use hex values such as `2EFF27` which is green.
If you would like to use the default setting, u may delete this part of the code

`case_icons` [Optional] This setting allows you to customize the case icons, you can either use custom emoji like `<:do_not_disturb:841799310797832244>` but note that zeppelin needs to be in the same server as the emote or it wont work or you can use default unicode emojis such as `:boot:`.  If you would like to use the default setting, u may delete this part of the code


```yaml
  cases:
    replaceDefaultOverrides: true #replaces default settings if true
    config:
      log_automatic_actions: true
      case_log_channel: "851837989545050162" #cases channel
      #case_log_channel: *cases
      show_relative_times: true
      relative_time_cutoff: 7d
      case_colors:
        warn: yellow
        ban: red
        unban: 2EFF27 #green
        note: FEE9E9 #whitish
        kick: F34B80 #pinkish
        mute: yellow
        unmute: 2EFF27 #green
        deleted: orange
        softban: F73C4F #Lighter shade of red
      case_icons:
        warn: ":warning:"
        ban: ":hammer:"
        unban: ":green_circle:"
        note: ":pencil:"

### Companion Channels

<details>
  <summary>Click to view</summary>
  
Set up 'companion channels' between text and voice channels. Once set up, any time a user joins one of the specified voice channels, they'll get channel permissions applied to them for the text channels.


`permissions` This number can be calculated using  https://discordapi.com/permissions.html which allows you to set the behaviour of the linked channel (e.g read only channel, visible only on vc join etc.)


**NOTE**

> The companion channels plugin doesn't currently look at member-related information for overrides, so level overrides don't work

#### PLUGIN CODE

```yaml
  companion_channels:
    replaceDefaultOverrides: true #replaces default settings if true
    config:
      entries:
        public_vcs: #name of the entry, could be anything
          voice_channel_ids:
            - "851845471587926086" #vc channel
            #- *vc1
          text_channel_ids:
            - "851845490298454026" #text channel
            #- *text1
          permissions: 52224
          enabled: true
```

### Counters

**COUNTER TIP**

>Counter decays are currently processed every 5 minutes. They are, however, still applied according to the decay time, even if it's lower than 5 minutes, so "1 every 30s" would decay 10 points at once every 5 minutes.

### Reaction Roles

<details>
  <summary>Click to view</summary>
  
Allows you to add reaction roles to a given message.

PERMISSIONS

`can_manage` is needed to use this plugin and its commands


USAGE

**ADDING REACTION ROLES**

To add reaction roles, use the format below!

If the message you specify is not found, use `!save_messages_to_db <channelId> <messageId>`
to manually add it to the stored messages database permanently and try again!

```yaml
!reaction_roles messageid
emoji1 = roleid1
emoji2 = roleid2
```

Example
```yaml
!reaction_roles 800865377520582687
üëç = 556110793058287637
üëé = 558037973581430785
```


**CLEAR**

`!reaction_roles clear MESSAGEID` to clear reaction roles. Incase this does not work, save to database and try again! *see below*

STEPS:

1. `!save_messages_to_db 534722948246929429-858626287895314472`

2. `!reaction_roles clear 858626287895314472`


**REACTION ROLE TIP**

`auto_refresh_interval` for reaction roles sets how often the reactions are "refreshed", i.e. removed and re-added. This is done because high-volume reactions like reaction roles can become very glitchy after some time if they're not reset. To fix this, you can refresh them!

**REFRESH**

`!reaction_roles refresh MESSAGEID` to refresh reaction roles. Incase this does not work, save to database and try again! *see below*

STEPS:

1. `!save_messages_to_db 534722948246929429-858626287895314472`

2. `!reaction_roles refresh 858626287895314472`

#### PLUGIN CODE

```yaml
  reaction_roles:
    replaceDefaultOverrides: true #replaces default settings if true
    config:
      auto_refresh_interval: 900000 #re-adds reactions after x seconds
      remove_user_reactions: true #remove user reaction or let it stay
    overrides:
      - level: '>=100'
        config:
          can_manage: true #only level 100 can manage

                  This server is the support server for the site **[discord.io](https://discord.io/)**.

                  Through us, anyone can create a custom invite link for free. However, when those links expire, people often get confused and stumble here.

                  We are not the server you intended to join. If you can, please let the person who gave you the link know that it has expired. Thank you!
